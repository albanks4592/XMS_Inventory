# XMS_Inventory
A web app that tracks and displays the virtual infrastructure we manage.

# Discription
This code is an example of some C# code I wrote which was part of a larger project. I removed all the work that I did not do and unfortunately, it will not run since it needs to be connected to an active directory server for authentication and a database which I could not upload. The code is heavily commented so you can folllow what I am trying to do.
